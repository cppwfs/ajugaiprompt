Provide a sample Spring AI application that demonstrates basic prompts

== Requirements:

* Java 17 or Above

== Build:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

== Execute:

[source,shell]
----
export spring_ai_openai_apiKey=<your chatgpt key>
java -jar target/ajugaiprompt-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

=== Example URLs you can use
In our examples below we will ask the following question
`Write an outline of a lightning talk on topic of spring ai and provide a coding example`

==== Without prompt engineering uses the /basic endpoint for example:

```
http://localhost:8080/basic?question=Write%20an%20outline%20of%20a%20lightning%20talk%20on%20topic%20of%20spring%20ai%20and%20provide%20a%20coding%20example
```

==== With prompt engineering uses the pro endpoint for example:

```
http://localhost:8080/pro?question=Write%20an%20outline%20of%20a%20lightning%20talk%20on%20topic%20of%20spring%20ai%20and%20provide%20a%20coding%20example
```
